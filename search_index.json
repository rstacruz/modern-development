They'll be merged back in when finished. In practice, the develop branch only has merge commits from feature branches.\n\n\n\n\nThe develop branch is always in a \"ready to test\" state. All automated tests should always be passing in this branch. You should also set up a staging server to sync with the latest develop version for testing (see automated deployments).\nThe master branch\nThe master is maintained to be in a production-ready state. While the develop branch is ready for developers and testers, the master branch is ready for users.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of a sprint, the develop branch will be merged into master.

This is perfect for our branch-based approach of working in branches and asking your teammates to review them.\nCreating pull requests\nCreate a pull request from your feature branch (eg, feature/login) into the main branch (ie, develop). This is usually created before, or just around the time, a feature branch is finished.\n\n\n\n\nWriting a pull request\nWrite a short title for your pull request. A good format to follow is:\n: \nWrite a short paragraph summarizing your changes. Include these additional details as well:\n\nScreenshots.

Senior members typically do most the reviews in practice, but any member of the team can review pull requests as long as they can satisfy the responsibilities listed above.\nThe only person who can't review the code is the original author.\nUnderstanding the pull request\nAs a pull request reviewer, you will be partly responsible for the pull request's code. If anyone has concerns about it in the future, it's going to be the author and the reviewer who should be able to answer these concerns.\nA reviewer should also test the pull request, if possible.\nApproving\nSimple.

To build a release, you'll need to do these steps:\n\nMerge develop into master.\nMerge master back into develop (if needed).\nCreate a release.\n\nMerging into a clean master\nFor clean merges of develop into master, you can use the GitHub interface. Simply create a pull request from develop into master and merge it using the GitHub website. This works when master is clean and up-to-date with the latest develop branch, and has no merge conflicts.\nMerging into a dirty master\nIf master has changes that are out-of-sync with develop, you may run into merge conflicts. The only way to resolve this is by using the command line. This is the only time pushing directly into master is acceptable.\n# Switch to the master branch\ngit checkout master\n\n# Merge develop into master; do a fetch first\n# to ensure we have the latest origin/develop\nget fetch\ngit merge origin/develop --no-ff\n\n# Resolve any conflicts and commit the result\ngit mergetool\ngit commit\n\n# Push into master\ngit push\n\nSynchronizing develop\nThere are commits in master that are not in develop, it may be a good time to merge those into develop. Make a pull request of master back into develop. Doing this is not necessary, but it will clean up your git history.\nCreating a release\nEvery deployment should have a version number tag. Simply create a release in GitHub. This will create a git tag for you (equivalent to git tag v1.0.4 master && git push --tags).\n\nCreate a GitHub release for the latest master.\nTag it in the format vX.X.X (eg, v1.0.4).\n\n\n\nCreating a new GitHub release.\n\n\n\nNext: Emergency fixes\n\n"},"git/hotfix.html":{"url":"git/hotfix.html","title":"Emergency fixes","keywords":"","body":"Emergency fixes\nThere are times when bug fixes must be made outside the release cycle. This is called a hotfix.\nThe main branches (develop and master) are never to be pushed directly to, and hotfixes are no excuse to violate this rule. Instead, they should be made as hotfix branches.\nHotfix branches\nHotfixes branches are just like feature branches. They're worked on in the same way: pull requests, review, merge. The only difference is that they're branched from master instead of develop.\n# Switch to the master branch\ngit checkout master\n\n# Create your branch\ngit branch hotfix/security-fix\n\n# Start working!\n\nMerging hotfixes\nPull requests are made for hotfixes too, just like feature branches. A colleague will have to review and merge your pull request, ideally.\nThe master branch will be updated once a pull request is merged in. This should trigger your automated deployment process and deploy the hotfix to production servers.\nSyncing the develop branch\nOnce the pull request is merged, master now has the fixes, but not develop. In these cases, you can do one of two things:\n\nOption A: Merge master back into develop.\nOption B: Merge the hotfix into develop as well (\"backporting\").\n\nOption A is preferred in most cases, with option B only being used when merging master back may be too complicated.\nSelf-merging\nThere may be cases when fixes are time-sensitive and colleagues aren't available to review and merge your changes.

This isn't the only way to use Git. In fact, the most obvious way to use Git is how the Git manual first tells us to: push all commits to a single master branch.\nThis works for solo developers, but it breaks down once you have two or more on the team. Let's go through the problems that would come up in a single-branch model.\nProblem: changes aren't contiguous\n    X - X - O - O - X - O                  X - X - X - O - O - O\n\n    Working on a single branch             Working using feature branches\n    (interleaved)                          (contiguous)\nIf two people are working on 2 features, their commits may end up being interleaved. That is, for features X and O, the commits for either feature may not show up next to each other. This makes reviewing changes more difficult.\nProblem: changes can't be reverted\nTo revert a feature that spans multiple commits, all those commits have to be reverted individually.\n# Single-branch workflow: reverting each commit individually\ngit revert 1a84c2b9\ngit revert 9bf3cb70\ngit revert 6b9c5cb4\ngit revert 215c3820\n\nGit solves this by grouping multiple commits together into a single merge commit. This is what happens when a pull request is merged. This merge commit can then be reverted, and doing so will revert all commits that it groups together.\n# Feature branch workflow: only one commit to revert\n# (Assuming 75a6c2a0 is a merge commit)\ngit revert 75a6c2a0 -m 1\n\nProblem: reviewing is difficult\n\n\n\n\nIt becomes harder to review changes when they're not contiguous or grouped in any way. By grouping them together, you can create a GitHub pull request where your peers can browse through your changes easily.\nThe solution\nThe Git workflow described in this chapter is a logical evolution brought about by the problems above. By compartmentalizing each piece of work into branches, we make it easier to manage large amounts of work over long periods of time.\n\nNext: Let's recap what we've learned.\n\n"},"git/summary.html":{"url":"git/summary.html","title":"Summary","keywords":"","body":"Summary\nThe branch-based Git workflow helps your team collaborate seamlessly.

At the very least, you should have a CI service configured for your project to:\n\nRun tests in every git push to your repository.\nDisplay test results in GitHub and Slack.\n\nSetting up automated testing\nSet up your CI to run tests on every Git push. The steps for this varies for every CI service, so consult your CI manual for details. Typically, this means listing a set of commands that your CI will run when it detects changes. Here's a contrived example:\n# Example CI script for Node.js and Ruby\nnpm install\nbundle install --path=vendor/bundle\nnpm test\nbundle exec rspec\n\nGitHub integration\n\n\n\n\nWhen reviewing pull requests, you'll need to ensure that the tests are adequate and passing.

Contrast this to legacy projects, where deployment may involve manually transfering files and using a browser to invoke certain commands. These tasks need to be automated so they can be repeatable and protected from human errors.\nExample\nFor websites hosted on Heroku, their platform already takes care of deploy automation for you. To update a Heroku website, you simply need to do a git push:\n# Deploy your app into Heroku's hosting platform\ngit push heroku master\n\nIn other cases, you'd have to use other tools. For Ruby projects, Capistrano is a popular choice. A typical Ruby/Capistrano project would be deployed like so:\n# Deploy your app using Capistrano\nbundle exec cap production deploy\n\nHow to set up deployments\nThere are many different tools for this for many different programming languages. Some popular ones include:\n\nFabric (Python)\nCapistrano (Ruby)\nShipit (Node.js)\nEdeliver (Elixir and Erlang)\n\nIt doesn't matter which solution you pick, as long as your project's deployments are easy, automated, and reliable.\n\nNext: Use your CI to maintain a staging system.\n\n"},"automation/staging.html":{"url":"automation/staging.html","title":"The staging system","keywords":"","body":"The staging system\n\n\n\n\nIn web development, a staging server is a separate site where the latest development version is always available. It's completely separate from your production system. This lets your developers, testers, and stakeholders try the latest changes without having to touch the production system.\nSetting up a staging system\nThe most ideal staging setup is a system that's exactly like your production system: same type of server, same type of databases, but hosted separately. You can use a cheaper configuration, since less people will be using your staging.\nMost projects start with using Heroku for their staging system. It's free, it supports almost every programming language, and setting a new website up takes 2 commands (see Heroku's documentation).\nAutomating staging updates\n\n\nExample deploy script in Semaphore.\n\n\nA typical CI setup is have the following auto-deployments done:\n\nAuto deploy passing tests in branch develop to your staging server.\nAuto deploy passing tests in branch master to your production server.\n\nWhen tests pass in a given branch, an auto deploy script will simply run certain commands.\n\n\nSetting up auto deployment in Semaphore.\n -->\nSeeding a staging system\nThe data in a staging system is completely different from your production system. It will probably start off as blank. You'll need some test data in your staging server to make it look like a production server. Making dummy data is a process called seeding. Seeding generates some dummy users, articles, and whatever your project needs to get it to a state where it \"looks\" like a production system.\nTo do this, you'll make a seed script in your project invoked by a certain command. In Rails projects, that's:\n# Invokes db/seeds.rb\nbundle exec rails db:seed\n\n\nNext: Track your code's health with code coverage reporting.\n\n"},"automation/coverage.html":{"url":"automation/coverage.html","title":"Coverage reporting","keywords":"","body":"Coverage reporting\n\n\n\n\nTests are often measured by how thorough they are using a metric called code coverage.\nCode coverage is measured in percentage points. It approximates how much of the system is tested with a given test suite. A code coverage of 80% means that running the test suite ran 80% of the code in the project. The higher the number, the better.\nWhy track code coverage\nCode coverage is often used to gauge the health of a project's test suite. Coverage will go down when changes are introduced without any tests. It's a good idea to track a project's code coverage to help reviewers gauge code quality of pull requests.\nCode coverage services\nCI services don't typically offer code coverage tracking. There are, however, other platforms that offer this. Like CI's, they're typically free for open source projects, with paid plans available for private projects. Here's a list of some popular services:\n\nCoveralls.io is popular with open source projects.\nCodeClimate offers code coverage tools as well as other \"health\" checks.\n\nAre they worth it?\nCode coverage reports offer valuable insight into a project's code quality.

Smoke tests are small and also easy to make. Integration tests are larger and harder to maintain, so it's often more economical to prioritize writing smaller unit tests.\nIn the Git workflow\nThe main branches master and develop must always be in a working state. Pull requests can't be merged until their tests pass.\n\nNext: What are unit, integration, and smoke tests?\n\n"},"coding/test_types.html":{"url":"coding/test_types.html","title":"Types of tests","keywords":"","body":"Types of tests\nTests will commonly be either a unit test that tests one thing, or an integration test that tests many things. Here's the same behavior tested in two different ways:\n# Unit test example: tests the model\ntest 'Article publishing' do\n  article.publish!\n  expect(article.published_at).to eq Time.now\nend\n\n# Integration test example: tests your router,\n# controller, view, and model all at once\ntest 'Article publishing' do\n  post '/articles/my-draft-article/publish'\n  expect(article.published_at).to eq Time.now\nend\n\nIn web development, unit tests are often written for models and services, while integration tests are for controllers.\nSmoke tests\nA smoke test is a very shallow integration test. It usually just tries something and expects no errors to happen. The name comes from testing electronics to check if turning a device on produces smoke. In web development, it usually means just visiting a path and checking for errors.\ntest 'No fires happen' do\n  visit '/article/my-article'\n  expect(response.code).to eq 200\nend\n\nThe simple test above will already check for a lot of things:\n\nAny errors in the view templates\nAny model or controller errors\nMiddleware in the app server\n\n\nSee also...\n\n\nTest-driven development (wikipedia.org)\n\n\n\n\nNext: Why do we write tests?\n\n"},"coding/why_test.html":{"url":"coding/why_test.html","title":"Why we test","keywords":"","body":"Why we test\nWriting tests make you work faster. This seems like a backward thought at first, since writing tests take time. In practice, these tests are automating parts of your workflow, and automation always makes you faster in the long run.\nF5-driven development\nLet's consider the alternative to TDD. Development in the console usually involves a REPL shell that lets you invoke some code in your project. Here's an example in a typical Rails project:\n$ bundle exec rails console\nLoading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)\n\nirb> User.new(first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Smith').full_name\n\"John Smith\"\n\nPeople often abuse REPL consoles as part of their coding process. A common anti-pattern is to use a REPL to test changes as you make them. A typical REPL workflow looks like this:\n\nMake some more changes.\nPress AltTab to switch to a terminal.\nPress Up then Enter to retry the last command.\n\nIn the case of web development, switching to a browser and hitting CtrlR or F5 to reload is also very common. Wouldn't it be easier to automate this process for you?\ntest 'Builds a full name do' do\n  user = User.new(\n    first_name: 'John',\n    last_name: 'Smith')\n\n  expect(user.full_name).to eq 'John Smith'\nend\n\nBy writing those same REPL commands as a test, you can now re-run it using ruby test/user_test.rb. In fact, you can run all the tests you've ever written!\nTests as insurance\nTests let you update code mercilessly. Have you ever been in a project that uses very old versions of 3rd-party libraries such as Rails or jQuery? These projects are too afraid to upgrade knowing it may break things.\nBy writing tests, you'll be alerted of breakages when updating your project's dependencies. Changing the jQuery version may make some tests fail. You'd know then where to fix things.\nRefactoring mercilessly\nTests aren't only for upgrading 3rd-party dependencies. Even updating one part in your project can result in breaking another part. A good refactoring process starts with writing tests. When changing code, it helps to know what it can break.\nTests as documentation\nWhile tests are no substitute for formal documentation, it can provide a quick reference for other developers. Consider this test:\ntest('OrderCalculator calculating charges', t => {\n  let order = {\n    type: 'pickup', // or 'deliver'\n    items: [\n      { product: 'Glazed donut', price: 2.99, qty: 2 },\n      { product: 'Coffee', price: 3.99, qty: 1 } ] }\n\n  let charges = OrderCalculator.getCharges(order)\n  t.deepEqual(changes, {\n    subtotal: 9.97,\n    tax: 1.19,\n    delivery: 0,\n    total: 11.16 })\n\n  t.end()\n})\n\nAnother developer would easily know at a glance what OrderCalculator does, what input it takes, and what results it yields.\n\nNext: Enforce code style guidelines through linting.\n\n"},"coding/linting.html":{"url":"coding/linting.html","title":"Linting","keywords":"","body":"Linting\n\n\n\n\nLinters are tools that enforce source code writing style based on a set of rules. It helps impose coding styleguides in an automated way. A linter will check decisions such as:\n\nSyntax errors\nTabs or spaces for indentation\nNaming of variables and functions\nUse of whitespace\nPatterns to use and to avoid\n\nIt's important to keep your coding style consistent. Even if it's mostly subjective, a consistent style helps maintain developer sanity and code readability.\nAutomated linting\nLinting should be part of your automated test suite. This lets you catch style violations before pull requests are merged. Here's an example using Travis CI:\n# Example .travis.yml configuration to run CS\n# and JavaScript linting\nscript:\n  - npm test\n  - npm run stylelint\n  - npm run eslint\n\nWhy use a linter\nLinting helps reviewers by catching style violations in automated tests so they don't have to. This means less effort needed for reviewing, and instant feedback for contributors.\n\n\nLinting prevents merging when style issues aren't fixed.\n\n\nChoose a coding style\nThere are many established styleguides and linter presets. Pick one and customize it if preferred. It doesn't matter which you choose, what's important is that your team has an authoritative set of rules that are enforced by a linter. This prevents petty \"bikeshedding\" arguments within your team. Here are some popular examples:\n\nJavaScript: Standard, XO\nCSS: Config standard\nRuby: Ruby Style Guide (via Rubocop)\n\nLinter examples\n\nStylelint for CSS\nEslint for JavaScript\nRubocop for Ruby\nCredo for Elixir\n\n\nNext: Make sure your project has a Readme file.\n\n"},"coding/readme_files.html":{"url":"coding/readme_files.html","title":"Readme files","keywords":"","body":"Readme files\nEvery project should have a README.md file in their Git repository.

We should be about 80% there right now.\n\nThis is the default channel for most discussions. Collaborating with stakeholders happens here. Most conversations should happen here, unless they happen to be too technical, in which case they should be in #dev.\nDeveloper channel\n\n#dev\n\nFred: Can you guys take a look at PR #283? I need a review\nVelma: Hold on, let me take a look at it.\n\nHave a channel where only developers are present, without any stakeholders. This is where everyday tech-related discussions will happen. Banter in this channel is usually not relevant to stakeholders, so it's best to leave them out so not to overwhelm them.\nTemporary channels\n\n#_facebook_campaign\n\nMarketer: We need a new landing page\nFred: We're on it. What do you need?\n\nCreate new channels for discussion threads, and archive them when you're done. This lets certain discussions happen separately from everyday chatter, keeping logs clean. It also prevents overwhelming people by leaving out those who may not be involved. A good practice is to these with an underscore, such as #_feature. \nWhen archiving temporary channels, rename them with a date stamp first (eg, #1701_facebook_campaign). This frees up the name so that it can be used again.\nProject tracker channel\n\n#issues\n\nGitHub: Shaggy submitted pull request #283: Homepage: fix responsive issues\nTrello: Scooby added a new card: Facebook landing pages\n\nIntegrate your project management tool (eg, Trello) and GitHub's pull requests into a channel such as #issues. Don't talk in this channel, take discussions to #general instead since conversations are hard to track among notifications.\nOther notifications\nAlso consider adding notifications for other services. This largely depends on the nature of your project. Here are some ideas:\n\n#analytics for website analytics (eg, Google Analytics)\n#support for customer support tickets (eg, Intercom)\n#code for GitHub activity\n#ding for sales notifications\n\n"}}}
